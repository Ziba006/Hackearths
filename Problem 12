# Problem
# You have been given a String S. You need to find and print whether this string is a palindrome
# or not. If yes, print "YES" (without quotes), else print "NO" (without quotes).

s = str(input())

def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]   # reverse using slicing

if is_palindrome(s):
    print("Yes")
else :
    print("No")
