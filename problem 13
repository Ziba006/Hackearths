# Problem
# You have been given 3 integers - l, r and k. Find how many numbers between l and r 
# (both inclusive) are divisible by k. You do not need to print these numbers, you just 
# have to find their count.

l, r, k = list(map(int,input().split()))

count = 0
for i in range(l,r+1):
    if (i%k == 0):
        # print(i)
        count = count +1
    else:
        count = count

print(count)
