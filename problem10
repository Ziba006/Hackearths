# Alice got a number written in seven segment format where each segment was creatted used a matchstick.

# Example: If Alice gets a number 123 so basically Alice used 12 matchsticks for this number.

# Alice is wondering what is the numerically largest value that she can generate by using at most the 
# matchsticks that she currently possess.Help Alice out by telling her that number.

#  Input Format:
# First line contains T (test cases).
# Next T lines contain a Number N.

# Output Format:
# Print the largest possible number numerically that can be generated using at max that many number of 
# matchsticks which was used to generate N.

matchsticks = {0:6, 1:2, 2:5, 3:5, 4:4, 5:5, 6:6, 7:3, 8:7, 9:6}

for i in range(t):
