# Problem
# You are required to enter a word that consists of x and y that denote the number of Zs and Os respectively.
#  The input word is considered similar to word zoo if 2x = y
# Determine if the entered word is similar to word zoo.

# For example, words such as zzoooo and zzzoooooo are similar to word zoo but not the words such as zzooo and zzzooooo.

# Input format
# First line: A word that starts with several Zs and continues by several Os.
# Note: The maximum length of this word must be 20

# Output format
# Print Yes if the input word can be considered as the string zoo otherwise, print No.

from collections import Counter
x = input()
no = Counter(x)

if(len(x)>20):
    print("Input too long")
else:
    num_Z = no.get('z',0)
    num_O = no.get('o',0)

    if(num_O == 2*num_Z):
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")

#in C 

#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
    int x[20];
    scanf("%20s", &x);

    int num_Z=0; int num_O=0;
    for(int i=0; x[i] !=0; i++){
        if(x[i]=='z' || x[i] == 'Z'){
            num_Z++;
        }
        else if(x[i]=='o' || x[i] == 'O'){
            num_O++;
        }
    }

    if(num_O == 2*num_Z){
        printf("Yes");
    }
    else{
        printf("No");
