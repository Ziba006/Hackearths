# Problem
# You are provided an array A of size N that contains non-negative integers. 
# Your task is to determine whether the number that is formed by selecting the last digit of all the
#  N numbers is divisible by 10

# Input format

# First line: A single integer N denoting the size of array 
# Second line: N space-separated integers.
# Output format
# If the number is divisible by 10 then print YEs Otherwise, print NO

n = int(input())
a = list(map(int,input().split()))

last_digit = ""
for i in a:
   if(i>=0):
      last_digit += str(i % 10)

number = int(last_digit)
print(number)

if(number % 10 == 0):
   print("YES")
else:
   print("No")
