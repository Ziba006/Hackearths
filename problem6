# Problem
# You live in a village. The village can be represented as a line that contains N
#  grids. Each grid can be denoted as a house that is marked as H or a blank space that is marked as ..

# A person lives in each house. A person can move to a grid if it is adjacent to that person. 
# Therefore, the grid must be present on the left and right side of that person.

# Now, you are required to put some fences that can be marked as B on some blank spaces so that 
# the village can be divided into several pieces. A person cannot walk past a fence but can walk
#  through a house. 

# You are required to divide the house based on the following rules:

# A person cannot reach a house that does not belong to that specific person.
# The number of grids each person can reach is the same and it includes the grid in which the house is situated.
# In order to show that you are enthusiastic and if there are many answers, then you are required to print the one where most fences are placed.
# Your task is to decide whether there is a possible solution. Print the possible solution.

# Input format

# First line: An integer N that represents the number of grids ( 1<= N<= 20 )
# Second line: N characters that indicate the villages that are represented as H or .

# Output format

# The output must be printed in the following format:
# First line: If possible, then print Yes Otherwise, print No
# Second line: If the answer is Yes then print the way to do so.

n  = int(input())
village  = list(input().strip())

for i in range(n):
    if village[i] == '.':
        village[i] ='B'

impossible = False

for i in range(1,n):
    if village[i] == 'H' and village[i-1] == 'H':
        impossible = True
        break

if impossible:
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")
    print("".join(village))
