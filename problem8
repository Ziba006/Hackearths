# You are conducting a contest at your college. This contest consists of two problems and 
#  participants. You know the problem that a candidate will solve during the contest.

# You provide a balloon to a participant after he or she solves a problem. There are only green and purple-colored balloons available in a market. Each problem must have a balloon associated with it as a prize for solving that specific problem. You can distribute balloons to each participant by performing the following operation:

# Use green-colored balloons for the first problem and purple-colored balloons for the second problem
# Use purple-colored balloons for the first problem and green-colored balloons for the second problem
# You are given the cost of each balloon and problems that each participant solve. Your task is to print the minimum price that you have to pay while purchasing balloons.

# Read number of test cases
t = int(input().strip())

# Check validity of test cases
if t < 1 or t > 10:
    print("Number of test cases must be between 1 and 10")
else:
    for _ in range(t):
        # Read balloon costs: green and purple
        g, p = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Number of participants
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        # Counters for problems solved
        count1, count2 = 0, 0
        
        # Read participants' solutions
        for _ in range(n):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            count1 += x   # if problem 1 is solved
            count2 += y   # if problem 2 is solved
        
        # Case 1: problem1 → green, problem2 → purple
        cost1 = count1 * g + count2 * p
        
        # Case 2: problem1 → purple, problem2 → green
        cost2 = count1 * p + count2 * g
        
        # Print minimum cost
        print(min(cost1, cost2))
